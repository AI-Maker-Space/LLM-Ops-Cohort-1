0,19 July 2023,Orlando_Gardner,9," Murphy is exceptional
","You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.",/review/rw9199470/?ref_=tt_urv

","One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.",/review/rw9202448/?ref_=tt_urv

","Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",/review/rw9202236/?ref_=tt_urv

I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that .

","I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film.

I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors.

","Although the time passed quickly, ultimately, Oppenheimer has left me disappointed. The problem with this film is that it can't decide which story it tries to tell - building the bomb or the inquiry of the national security committee. Both of those stories are depicted well, Nolan uses nice narrative devices to locate the characters in their currently depicted temporal location, etc. However, the cheap moral that the film concludes with has been beaten to death and because of that it undermines everything the script tried to achieve. The film didn't leave me speechless and a rather poorly executed sequence of the denotation doesn't really justify the historic development of a black and white IMAX film stock.",/review/rw9221158/?ref_=tt_urv

","Greetings again from the darkness. As pupils slouched in our school desks during history class, we easily and naturally disassociated with the many stories of war. World War II was lumped in with WWI, the Civil War, and The Revolutionary War. There were names and dates to memorize for quizzes and final exams, yet even with relatives recounting stories of kin, a personal connection was rare. As we aged and experienced modern-day warfare, the personal connection became all too real. Reality struck that soldiers are human beings with families, and despite their missions and marching orders, most are as innocent as the 'tragic civilian casualties' reported on the newswires. Along these lines, an aspect of war that has often remained overlooked is the behind-closed-doors decision-making of politicians and military leaders. Filmmaker-extraordinaire Christopher Nolan takes us behind those doors through the eyes of J Robert Oppenheimer, the Father of the Atomic Bomb. What we see is quite frightening.",/review/rw9207372/?ref_=tt_urv

40,21 July 2023,EdwardtheBlackPrince,8," Do the means justify the end?
","Oppenheimer has always been regarded by History as an interesting figure for the advancement of scientific discovery. While also being a rather controversial figure for his choices and mankind. Nolans Oppenheimer takes the audience on that dramatic epic of ethical proportions, in many ways, it is conflicting yet still fantasizing in every way Throughout the movie, you see the psyche and internal conflict, personal Matters left facing. The themes of the era with the red scare with McCarthyism, the paranoia and the shadow hanging over following Oppenheimer throughout. What the influence of such a weapon carries? The pressure put on a man. If the possibility of the enemy having such a thing, is it better to act before they do? Are the ones who claim to fight for you the ones to trust themselves? This is a movie about Mankind, not just the bomb being built, or the overall progress much of the war. Much like say The Imitation Game focusing on the war being fought behind the battle line. This is a very heavy dialogue-driven focus on the aspects of science and politics, and the psychological of Oppenheimer, but all of this things investing as you jump around these different time frames. Primary because of the great reforming given by like Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey who gives probably the second-best performance in this ensemble cast. With most of his films, the cinematography is done amazingly as well as the visuals that emphasize of fission and chain reactions of the panning landshot the use of and the lack of color, and of course the big payoff of the bomb and the impact of all, and the Explosions Performances that on the big screen can't be compared to watching it at home.",/review/rw9203717/?ref_=tt_urv

Hyperbole aside, we're only twenty-two plus years into the century, and not many of us will be around to confirm his hypothesis. So best? Well, that's very subjective. Important though, he might be onto something. Important in the way the latter part of the picture emphasizes Robert J. Oppenheimer's (Cillian Murphy) personal angst in leading a team that developed the capability of destroying the entire world and all of mankind.

","The story is presented really well and through the eyes of Oppenheimer. 90% of the movie feels like a flashback scene which though looks really cool, doesn't actually feel like something I would watch again. As in classic Nolan style 3 timelines are running simultaneously - before the atom bomb dropped, after and the present. I feel like this could have been handled better especially in the second half of the movie. The two main events in the movies the bomb explosion and the last act felt underwhelming. Actually the bomb explosion scene for which everyone was waiting so intently for was underwhelming beyond belief - Nolan should have used CGI 100%, it looked like an explosion from the 90s.

Like most Nolan films this lacks emotion. Oppenheimer was a stoic man for sure but he had moments of catharsis throughout his life. Having read the book this film is based on (American Prometheus) I noticed that many of the relationships that affected his (Oppie's) life and career, and his hypnotic charisma were sadly missing in this film. The whole idea of the book, more over the whole point of Oppie's infamous testimony, was to explain the actions by shedding light on the man. I'm disappointed to say that this is no tale of the man, rather a tale of the Los Alamos project and a couple of testimonies.

I was hoping to see more nitty gritty into the bomb's development, and maybe some footage of its use in Japan to really reinforce the human toll and destruction of the immensely powerful weapon that they had created for the final act. Instead its just dramatic closeups of Opp's troubled face. But I feel we needed some more visuals (of war) to establish more emotion.

","Like its subject, Christopher Nolan's OPPENHEIMER is bold, flawed and largely successful. An impressive production that - while wide in scale and covering a span of several decades, also manages to be an intimate biography of the man at its center - J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy). Nolan's screenplay (based on a book by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin) is divided into three basic movements, although the story freely bounces back and forth in time. Nolan further bisects the film into subjective vs. Objective viewpoints (signaled by Color and B&W photography, respectively).",/review/rw9263900/?ref_=tt_urv

But there's not a false note in the ensemble. Robert Oppenheimer is fascinating character. Hero or villain? The film gives us both perspectives and lets us decide for ourselves. The non linear storytelling works brilliantly because what could have seemed like two films works seamlessly as one. Three hours flies by.

The acting/cast were all incredible and so was the set design, and also the lack of CGI and special effects. The directing and camera work were awesome too. The middle part with them detonating the test bomb was a very well-constructed and tense scene. It was also intelligent in a way to only show the American perspective of the war and how out of touch/indifferent they were with the suffering that they inflicted on the Japanese civilian population, except of course for the main character. He was portrayed very well and this movie is coming out at a very critical time in history, reminding us of the destructive potential of escalating to nuclear war with other countries (no matter the side) and that our responsibility with handling weaponized nuclear technology is not to be taken lightly, and we must have a moral conscience.

The Trinity Test scene was perfectly well done, no horror movie has ever made my heart beat as much as that scene did. Seeing Strauss turn against Oppenheimer was super interesting (RDJ did amazing as him as well). The entire hearing act did a good job at showing how the different motives against Oppenheimer resulted in his downfall. The final scene of the movie is one of the most perfect scenes of any film i've ever seen. Strauss was trying to understand what Oppenheimer said to Einstein that day (assuming it was something to push Einstein against him), but it ended up being something so much more deep.

134,26 July 2023,Holt344,10," Christopher Nolan gives us a brilliant drama with Cillian Murphy giving us his best performance yet, one of the best films of the decade - My Ultimate Review
","My expectations are always high for a film made by Christopher Nolan who oversees the whole production whilst directing and writing it, he never lets me down and for this feature film, a biopic about the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a theoretical physicist who was pivotal in developing the first nuclear weapons as part of the Manhattan Project, and thereby ushering in the Atomic Age. What we get is a three hour biopic of Oppenheimer's life and in my opinion each minute and each scene is used to the fullest. My girlfriend thought it was too long though so I think it's a preference. You could say the black and white scenes which have a different perspective character entirely, to be unnecessary for the story told and that's fair, but in my opinion it's a perspective character which is needed. Stories can easily become biased but with a perspective character like Strauss makes us see how others see Robert Oppenheimer and it only helps the story Christopher Nolan is telling. Any fan of Christopher Nolan knows how he likes a non linear story, he does it here and It's done perfectly. Alternating between Oppenheimer's story from Cambridge to Los Alamos, his security hearing in 1954, and Strauss' confirmation hearing in 1959.",/review/rw9215422/?ref_=tt_urv

The visual grandeur of Trinity underwhelmed me, but the music helped to compensate. Nolan has once again demonstrated his ability to present a political drama.

","Might sound absolutely blasphemous but I think this is better watched at home. This is not against the quality of the filmmaking, which was understandably amazing but the tediousness of it being an unintentional Oscar bait. There are tooo many characters, most looking similar and too dialogue heavy to be watching in theatres. The soundmixing leaves a lot of the dialogue to the imagination as well. What I expected from it was not what I walked away with, this is not about the bomb rather than the political side of the bomb. So be prepared to sit through endless courtroom back-and-forth with characters introduced in almost every scene. If you are not already aware of exactly what happened to Oppenheimer esp his life after the bomb, you're gonna have a really hard time understanding whats going on. Thats where the paradox lies, can it be a masterfully crafted movie if you lose your audience before the credits? Because it absolutely is and most around me absolutely were. And then if you are already aware of everything that happened to Oppenheimer was it really necessary to play the plot twist game with a certain character throughout the entire movie? The whole movie was a bit of oxymoron, you get to see what you prolly didnt want to and didnt get to see what you most wanted to. I'm talking about the bomb obviously, I was heavily disappointed by the absence of it. The saving grace was the amazing acting performance by RDJ and Emily Blunt who both should be receiving Oscar nominations. Cillian Murphy did a great job as well but there were many scenes where I felt like I was watching Tommy Shelby instead of Robert Oppenheimer. The best part of watching Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer was when he had no dialogues because his eyes do a better job at portraying what Nolan was going for.
