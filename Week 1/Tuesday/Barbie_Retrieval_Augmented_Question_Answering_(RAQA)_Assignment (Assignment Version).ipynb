No longer allowing the talented cast, especially Gosling, to shine and make us laugh. It felt like the talents of Will Ferrell and Michael Cera were also somewhat underutilized. Interesting concept, had potential, but later in the movie, it definitely started to fall flat for me.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 85}),\n",

              "  Document(page_content=\"Review: The movie was very funny and really enjoyable to laugh at with the full theatre. However, the messages of the movie were the problem. I was never really sure what I was supposed to take away, there was nothing about finding equality or love it was all about how every man cat falls every woman or women can't be anything. It was really silly because there was no accurate reflection of America at any single point except for Barbie getting called a Fascist for no reason by a 14 year old. I enjoyed how they called out women for hating women and how they really tried to preach empowerment and the ability to be anything, but at the same time there was so much resentment and they ended the movie by reinstating hate. The majority of the movie was hating men as much as possible. That's just whatever because what really matters is the story. Well it fell short on that mark and it was really disappointing. The pacing was horrible, the villain won and was pretty irrelevant in the long run,\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 17})]}"

It is not anti-men, it does not portray men as \"stupid\". Take a moment to think about how women have been portrayed in movies over the last century - oh yes, just as Ken is here! The movie exaggerates this, yes. That is the point. To clearly (and humourously) highlight the inequalities when the roles are reversed.
