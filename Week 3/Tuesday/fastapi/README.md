# Serving a Scalable Fast API application leveraging Celery and Redis

### Pre-requisites:

- You must deploy it on a GPU with ~16GB of memory
- You will need `docker compose` (HINT: Do not use `docker-compose`)
    - [Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/#install-the-plugin-manually)
- You will need to ensure `nvidia-ctk --version` provides a valid output
    - [Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)
 
### Tasks:

1. Provide a simple system diagram (created in whatever format you feel best communicates the flow) for the application

This is meant to be a challenging task - so you might need to spend some time troubleshooting and tinkering!
