# Creating a more robust RAQA system using LlamaIndex

We'll be putting together a system for querying both qualitative and quantitative data using LlamaIndex. 

To stick to a theme, we'll continue to use BarbenHeimer data as our base - but this can, and should, be extended to other topics/domains.

# Build 🏗️
There are 3 main tasks in this notebook:

- Create a Qualitative VectorStore query engine
- Create a quantitative NLtoSQL query engine
- Combine the two using LlamaIndex's OpenAI agent framework.

# Ship 🚢
Create an host a Gradio or Chainlit application to serve your project on Hugging Face spaces.
