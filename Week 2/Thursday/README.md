# Building A Finetuning Machine Using Chainlit

Today we'll take a look at how we can wrap our finetuning process into Chainlit and have our own dynamic fine-tuning machine. 

We'll be leveraging [this](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/LLM-Ops-Cohort-1/blob/main/Week%202/Thursday/Automated%20Fine-tuning%20with%20LLamaIndex.ipynb) notebook for finetuning.

# Build 🏗️
There are 2 main tasks for this assignment:

- Verify you can run the notebook
- Wrap the notebook using Chainlit

# Ship 🚢
Construct a Chainlit application using the notebook that allows users to interface with the application.

# Share 🚀
Make a social media post about your final application and tag @AIMakerspace
